I took \\(4+4+5+5+5+5+4+5=36\\) courses in my undergraduate degree.

`Favorite Courses:`

COMP 551, COMP 579, COMP 350, COMP 273, COMP 252, COMP 362

`Summary of Courses Taken:`

### U3 Winter 2025
- COMP 345 : (easy)\\
Good course. Take this prior to a 500 level ML course.

- COMP 421 : (medium)\\
Not for me. But you should take it, systems knowledge is valuable.

- COMP 535 (medium++) \\
 Not enough low level coding in my opinion.

- MATH 340 (medium)\\
Good course. Take it when Sergey is teaching.

- PHIL 240 (writing) \\
Not for me (elective). Take Intro. Phil if you want to do Phil as an elective.

### U3 Fall 2024
- COMP 321 : (medium) \\
Good course. Take it early and learn the patterns.

- COMP 350 : (medium) \\
Good course. Loved the prof. Worst part is MatLab.

- COMP 557 (medium++) \\
Good course. Loved prof.Kry but only take it if you have an interest in graphics.

- MATH 315 (easy++)\\
Good course (elective).

### U2 Winter 2024
- COMP 310 : (medium) \\
Good course.

- COMP 322 : (easy) \\
Good Course.

- COMP 362 : (hard++) \\
Good Course. Like COMP 252, was very hard for me but loved the material.

- COMP 400 : (medium) \\
Good Course. Prof Finding: Cold email profs, take their 500 level courses, go to OH.

- COMP 579 : (medium) \\
Good Course. Lectures are hard, assignments are more than fair.

### U2 Fall 2023
- COMP 330 : (medium) \\
Good Course. (If you like theory)

- COMP 370 : (easy) \\
Good Course. Data Sci Course from a practical perspective.

- COMP 550 : (medium++) \\
Good Course. A lot of project work. Lots of historical NLP topics.

- COMP 551 : (medium++) \\
Good Course. A lot of project work. Essential for ML.

### U1 Winter 2023
- COMP 252 : (hard++) \\
Good Course. I love Luc! But this course is not easy!

- COMP 302 : (medium++) \\
Good Course.

- COMP 303 : (easy++) \\
Not for me. Should be project based, I liked Prof Guo.

- MATH 324 : (medium)\\
Good Course. Refresh on MATH 323 first.

- PSYC 215 : (medium++) \\
Not for me (elective). Instead, take Intro Psyc.
  
### U1 Fall 2022
- COMP 206 : (medium++) \\
Good Course. Content is not hard but grading scheme made it hard to get an A.

- COMP 273 : (medium)\\
Good Course. I ended up TAing for it!

- MATH 208 : (easy)\\
Good Course. All R programming.

- MATH 240 : (medium)\\

### U0 Winter 2022
- CHEM 120 : (medium)\\
Good Course.

- COMP 250 : (medium)\\
Good Course. I'd say take COMP 202 first even if you are confident in your skills.

- MATH 151 : (hard)\\
Not for me. Take the normal stream. If you take this, go to all tutorials.

- PHYS 142 : (medium++)\\
Good Course. There is probably little point in taking this harder version if not required.

### U0 Fall 2021
- CHEM 110 : (easy)\\
Good Course.

- MATH 133 : (medium++)\\
Good Course. Harder than the second linear algebra course in my opinion.

- MATH 150 : (hard)\\
Not for me. I took it during COVID, it was very challenging.

- PHYS 131 : (hard)\\
Not for me. Harder than PHYS 142.
