## Progress
I started climbing the Summer of `2024`. 

Current highest climbed grade: `V7` (@ Cafe Bloc)

- First V5 in ~4 months
- Plateaued after this.
- First V6 in March 2025.
- The same month I managed to get a soft V7.

## Shoes

Shoes don't matter at the start.

I found a pair of [Evolv Phantoms](https://climbinghouse.com/evolv-phantom-review-shoes/) for *much* cheaper than the original price, second hand.


## Advice
I have not been climbing for long but:
- Prioritize fun over training, it takes a long time for your fingers to adapt anyways.
- Look at second hand markets when buying shoes!
- Find people to climb with.
